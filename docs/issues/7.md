# Instructions: Design and Implement `ReviewSession` and `ReviewItem` Data Models

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design the `ReviewSession` data model:**

   - Include fields for session metadata: `id`, `userId` (multi-user supported), `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `score`, `completed`, `settings` (optional), and `source` (e.g., "wanikani", "custom").
   - Add an `items` field to hold an array of `ReviewItem` objects.

2. **Design the `ReviewItem` data model:**

   - Include fields: `id`, `wanikaniId` (subject_id from WaniKani API), `type` ("radical" | "kanji" | "vocabulary"), `questionType` ("meaning" | "reading"), `question`, `expectedAnswer`, `userAnswer`, `result` ("correct" | "incorrect" | "skipped"), `startedAt`, `answeredAt`, `audioUrl` (optional), `character`, `auxiliaryMeanings` (optional), and `mnemonic` (optional).
   - Ensure compatibility with WaniKani API `/subjects` and `/assignments` endpoints.
   - No additional fields are required at this time.

3. **Support partial/incomplete sessions:**

   - Allow sessions to be saved with `completed: false` and resumed or discarded later.

4. **Persistence:**

   - For now, store sessions and items in memory (suitable for prototyping).
   - Support multi-user sessions from the start.
   - Design the data access layer as an interface or abstraction so that switching to a persistent data store (e.g., local storage or backend database) in the future is straightforward.

5. **Privacy and Security:**

   - Do not expose user IDs or answers publicly.
   - Never store WaniKani API keys in client-side code or logs.
   - If user accounts are supported, provide a way for users to delete their data (GDPR compliance).

6. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the models as TypeScript interfaces, types, or classes.
   - Add serialization and validation logic as needed.
   - Write unit tests to validate model logic and serialization.
   - Document the models with docstrings or markdown as appropriate.

## Next Steps

- Finalize the field lists and types for both models.
- Implement and test the models in the codebase.
- Document the models and their usage.

## Remaining Questions

- When should we plan to move from in-memory storage to a more persistent solution? (Note: the code should be designed to make this transition easy.)
