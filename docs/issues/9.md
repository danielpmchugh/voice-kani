# Create initial state management for review sessions

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Choose a state management approach (e.g., React Context, Redux, Zustand, or similar)
  - **Recommendation:** Use **Zustand** for state management. Zustand is lightweight, easy to use, works seamlessly with React, and is well-suited for managing session state and future extensibility. It allows for simple store creation, supports middleware, and can be easily interfaced for future persistence needs.
- [ ] Implement a store or context to manage the lifecycle of a ReviewSession
- [ ] Support adding, updating, and removing ReviewItems within a session
- [ ] Persist session state in memory (with an interface for future persistence)
- [ ] Provide hooks or utilities for components to access and update session state
- [ ] Add unit tests for state management logic
- [ ] Document usage and API for state management

## Notes

- Undo/redo functionality is **not required** for review session state management.

## Recommendation: Resetting/Clearing State

- Provide a dedicated `resetSession` or `clearSession` action in the Zustand store.
- This action should clear all session data and return the store to its initial state.
- Call this action automatically when a session ends, is abandoned, or a new session is started.
- Optionally, prompt the user for confirmation before clearing if there is unsaved progress.

## Questions

- How should state be reset or cleared between sessions?

Please discuss and assign subtasks as needed.
