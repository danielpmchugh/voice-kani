# Development Workflow: Set up CI/CD pipeline and development scripts

**Labels:** setup, workflow, phase1

---

This issue tracks the tasks under the 'Development Workflow' section of Phase 1 Project Setup:

## CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] **Set up CI/CD pipeline**

  - [ ] **Configure GitHub Actions**

    - Deploy every PR to its own staging slot in Azure Container Apps for testing.
    - Staging slot should be deleted after the PR is closed or merged.
    - Any push to `main` should trigger a canary deployment to the production Azure Container App.
    - **Staging Slot Naming Convention:**
      - Use `pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<SHORT_SHA>` (e.g., `pr-42-a1b2c3d`) for each PR deployment slot.
    - **Teams Notification:**
      - Notify the team in Slack when a deployment (staging or canary) is live.
    - **Required Credentials for GitHub Workflow:**
      - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
      - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
      - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
      - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
      - `AZURE_CONTAINERAPPS_ENVIRONMENT`
      - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`
      - `AZURE_CONTAINERAPP_NAME`
      - (Teams webhook URL for notifications)

  - [ ] **Set up automated testing**
    - **Recommendation:** Use **Jest** as the primary testing framework and for code coverage. Jest is fast, well-supported, and integrates easily with TypeScript and CI/CD. If we use Vite as our build tool, consider **Vitest** for even faster feedback. Configure coverage thresholds and reporting in CI to ensure code quality.
  - [ ] **Configure deployment workflow**
    - **For Pull Requests (PRs):**
      - On every PR, build and deploy the app to a unique staging slot in Azure Container Apps using the naming convention `pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<SHORT_SHA>`.
      - Post the staging slot URL as a comment in the PR for reviewers to test.
      - Ensure the staging slot is deleted automatically when the PR is closed or merged.
      - Run all tests and lint checks before deployment; fail the deployment if any checks do not pass.
    - **For Main Branch:**
      - On every push to `main`, build and deploy the app to the production Azure Container App using a canary deployment strategy.
      - Ensure zero-downtime deployment and automatic rollback on failure.
      - Notify the team in Microsoft Teams when a canary deployment is live, including deployment details and links.
    - **Secrets and Configuration:**
      - Use GitHub Actions secrets for all Azure credentials and Teams webhook URLs.
      - Ensure environment variables are securely injected into the deployment.
    - **Cleanup and Monitoring:**
      - Automate cleanup of old or orphaned staging slots.
      - Monitor deployment status and surface errors in PR comments and Teams notifications.
    - **Documentation:**
      - Document the deployment process and troubleshooting steps in the repository's README or a dedicated deployment guide.

## Development Scripts

- [ ] **Set up development scripts**
  - [ ] **Add npm scripts for common tasks**
    - The following essential npm scripts are already present in package.json:
      - `dev`: Starts the Next.js development server
      - `build`: Builds the Next.js app for production
      - `start`: Starts the production server
      - `test`: Runs the Jest test suite
      - `test:watch`: Runs Jest in watch mode
      - `lint`: Runs ESLint for code linting
      - `format`: Formats code with Prettier
      - `prepare`: Sets up Husky for git hooks
    - These scripts support the core development, testing, and deployment workflow for the project.
  - [ ] **Configure development server**
    - There are currently no special requirements for the dev server beyond the default Next.js setup (`npm run dev`).
    - Mock APIs or integration with additional services may be considered in the future as the project evolves.
  - [ ] **Set up build process**
    - **Recommendation:** Use Next.js's built-in build system (with SWC/Turbopack). This is optimal for SSR/SSG, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and requires no custom Webpack or Vite configuration for most use cases.
    - No changes neededâ€”current setup is optimal.
  - Pre-commit and pre-push hooks will be enforced using Husky and lint-staged to ensure code quality before changes are pushed or committed.
