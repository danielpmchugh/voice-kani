# Voice-Enabled WaniKani Review System - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the WaniKani review system with voice input capabilities and improved results visualization.

## Problem Statement
Users currently need to type their answers during WaniKani review sessions. This can be time-consuming and may not be the most efficient way to practice Japanese language learning. Additionally, the current results dashboard could provide more valuable insights for users to track their progress.

## Goals
1. Enable voice-based input for WaniKani reviews
2. Enhance the results dashboard with more detailed analytics and visualizations

## Non-Goals
- Replacing the existing typing-based input system
- Modifying the core WaniKani review mechanics
- Changing the SRS (Spaced Repetition System) algorithm

## User Stories

### Voice Input Feature
1. As a user, I want to speak my answers during reviews so I can practice pronunciation and save time
2. As a user, I want to toggle between voice and text input based on my preference
3. As a user, I want to see visual feedback when my voice is being recorded
4. As a user, I want to be able to cancel a voice recording if I make a mistake

### Results Dashboard Improvements
1. As a user, I want to see detailed statistics about my review performance
2. As a user, I want to track my progress over time with visual charts
3. As a user, I want to identify my weak areas to focus my studies
4. As a user, I want to compare my performance across different time periods
